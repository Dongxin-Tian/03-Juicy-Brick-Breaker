Juicy Brick Breaker

## Implementation
There are three levels. The first one features different colors of bricks. The second one shapes like a house and requires two hit for one brick. In the third level, the brick groups will spin and it's much more difficult to hit.
The player can get five lives for each play through. When a brick is breaked, the player gains 100 points to the score.
By letting the ball hit the edge section of the paddle, it can adjust the ball's direction for more controls.
Once a brick is breaked, there is a small chance to drop items, including one that extends the paddle's size and one that shrinks the paddle's size for a limited time.
